/**
 * AuthorDTO and PlaceDTO are defined here intentionally as nested response classes.
 *
 * When Mongoose populates 'author' and 'place', they resolve from ObjectIds into
 * full nested objects (e.g. author becomes { _id, username, profilePicture, email... }).
 * 
 * Without dedicated DTO classes, plainToInstance() has no way to know which fields
 * to expose on those nested objects when excludeExtraneousValues: true is set.
 * This caused two problems:
 *   1. All nested fields were stripped entirely, returning author: {} and place: {}
 *   2. Or sensitive nested fields leaked through without any filtering
 *
 * By defining AuthorDTO and PlaceDTO with explicit @Expose() decorators, and
 * linking them via @Type(() => AuthorDTO) and @Type(() => PlaceDTO) on the parent,
 * class-transformer knows exactly which nested fields to include and which to strip.
